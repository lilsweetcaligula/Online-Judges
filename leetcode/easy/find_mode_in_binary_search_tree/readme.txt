Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
[href.] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
  Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
